A set is an unordered collection of elements without duplicate entries.
When printed, iterated or converted into a sequence, its elements will appear in an arbitrary order.

Task

Now, let's use our knowledge of sets and help Mickey.

Ms. Gabriel Williams is a botany professor at District College. 
One day, she asked her student Mickey to compute the average of all the plants with 
distinct heights in her greenhouse.
"""


def average(array):
    return sum(set(array))/len(set(array))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int,input().split()))
    result = average(arr)
    print(result)
